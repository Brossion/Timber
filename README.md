# Timber
Simple Timberman game created using SFML

With music, SFX and everything!

What I learned during this project:

- How to create textures and sprites. Which I created a texture and then used that texture for creating sprites. Appearently this makes game faster since images hold lots of space in the memory.
- How to use Enums effectively
- Syntax usage (Loops)
- How to detect if a key is released (by creating a pollevent)
- And many many new things
